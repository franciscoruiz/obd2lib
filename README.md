obd2lib
=======

OBD-2 library to read information from cars.

The idea is to record as much information as the car support to create graphs
and stats with that data about the car.

This software is based on Karmind project (http://www.karmind.com/) and its
software published under GPL license.

Since I did not receive any answer from the original authors, I started coding
by myself and changing some functionality that I need.
